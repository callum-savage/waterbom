\title{Get a list of gauging stations}
\usage{
get_station_list(
  station_no = NULL,
  station_name = NULL,
  parametertype_name = NULL,
  bbox = NULL,
  ...,
  returnfields = c("station_no", "station_name", "station_latitude", "station_longitude")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{station_no}{Optionally, a character vector of station numbers. Accepts an asterix
'*' as a wildcard.}

\item{station_name}{Optionally, a character vector of station names. Accepts an asterix
'*' as a wildcard.}

\item{parametertype_name}{Optionally, a character vector of parameters.
Accepts an asterix '*' as a wildcard. This can be useful if, for instance, you are
only interested in stations which measure 'Water Course Discharge'. Use
\code{\link[=list_parameters]{list_parameters()}} to see available options.}

\item{bbox}{Optionally, a numeric vector of the form c(min_x, min_y, max_x,
max_y) which can be used to get stations in a specific bounding box.}

\item{...}{Optional named query fields which can be used to narrow the
request. Vectors of length greater than one will be collapsed into a comma
separated list. It is possible to use an asterix character '*' as a wildcard
in some fields, however this is not recommended as the naming conventions
can be inconsistent. Use \code{\link[=list_query_fields]{list_query_fields()}} to see available options,
including fields which accept a comma separated list or wildcard.}

\item{returnfields}{A character vector of columns to include in the returned
tibble. Use \link{list_query_fields("getStationList")} to see available options.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns determined by \code{returnfields}.
}
\description{
\code{get_station_list} queries the BOM API and returns a table of station
details. The list of stations can be narrowed by station number, station
name, parameter, or geographic area (bbox).
